# typo3-ext-migrate
This extension is not function-ready! 

Each installation is unique and needs different implementation of the commands und updates.

What you see here is our version of migrating a Typo3 v10 with bootstrap_package 11.04 to 12.0.12 trying to automate as much as possible.

Use it as an idea to build your own extension.
Feedback welcome!
